And Enphilistor, while warding off the raging Eddorian, directed a quiet thought as though he were addressing someone close by his side:</p><p>"Come in, please, one or more of the Elders. There is a situation here which I am not qualified to handle."</p><p>"We, the Elders of Arisia in fusion, are here."

The course of action which we must take has been determined long since. You will forget this incident completely. For cycles upon cycles of time to come no Eddorian shall know that we Arisians exist."</p></div> </div>
