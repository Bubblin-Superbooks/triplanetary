However, even at that we saved a lot of time. You can save quite a bit more, though, by having a rocket-plane come out to meet us somewhere around fifteen or twenty thousand kilometers, depending upon where you want to land. With their drives they can match our velocity and still make the drop direct."</p><p>"Guess I'll do thatâ€”thanks," and the operative called his chief, only to learn that his suggestion had already been acted upon.</p><p>"We beat you to it, Lyman," Samms smiled. "The <em>Silver Sliver</em> is out there now, looping to match your course, acceleraction, and velocity at twenty two thousand kilometers. You'll be ready to transfer?"</p><p>"I'll be ready," and the Quartermaster's ex-clerk went to his quarters and packed his dunnage-bag.</p></div> </div>
